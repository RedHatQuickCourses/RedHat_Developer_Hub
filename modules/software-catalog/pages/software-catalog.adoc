#  Software Catalog

[NOTE]
Organizations can customize the Software Catalog and most of Developer Hub. This allows
you to define what types of services or components should be included, how information is
structured, and what access rules regulate who can see or modify components and sections
of the portal.


The Software Catalog serves as a central registry for all software components, services, and resources within an organization. It provides a unified view and discoverability for developers.

*   **Overview**: A single pane of glass for all software assets, enabling developers to find, understand, and reuse existing components.
*   **Entities**: Represents various types of software components such as services, websites, libraries, APIs, and resources like databases or S3 buckets.
*   **`catalog-info.yaml` file**: A YAML descriptor file that defines metadata about a software component, including its owner, type, tags, and associated resources. This file is committed alongside the component's source code.
*   **Initial setup and component registration**: Involves setting up the catalog backend and registering new components by pointing the catalog to their `catalog-info.yaml` files.
